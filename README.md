# Projects
Op-amp over-voltage protection with hysteresis ensured shutdown above 10V and avoided chattering. AM radio receiver used tuning, detection and filtering to demodulate RF audio. Lead compensator improved winder stability and settling. Verilog lock used FSM for authentication, intrusion detection and auto reset.
